# Final Project: Create a ShinyApp with an Interactive Map

Due: 12/16

To bring the entire course together students will create an App with an interactive map as the central focus.

Requirements:
* One leaflet map
  * The app should have at least two different types of layers 
    * points/markers, lines, heatmap, polygons etc.
    * Leaflet map must make use of LeafletProxy for updating layers (observers)
* One (1) datatable, 
* Two (2) interactive charts or graphs (plotly)
* Three (3) input commands 
* One (1) downloadHandler that allows users to get the raw data they are viewing.

* Students who use _one or more API's_ to feed either their map or data displayed will receive 20 Bonus points on the assignment.

Applications should be deployed and working on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
